        <h2>Purpose of the Site</h2>
            <p>I wanted to be able to showcase my knowledge in programming, as well as display my other skill sets.</p>
            <p>By creating this website I am able to tell you more about myself, include information not found on a standard resume,</p>
            <p> and be able to have a physical display of some of the projects I was proud to be apart of, or create myself.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My name is Madison McGinnis and I am a senior at OU.</p>
            <p>I created this site using my HTML and CSS knowledge to showcase some of my accomplishments!</p>
            <p>You will find the navigation section to your left to learn more about myself and my projects, I hope</p>
            <p> this information find you well and I am proud to show you more about Madison McGinnis.</p>
